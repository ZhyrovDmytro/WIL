# Options

A stock option gives an investor the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at an agreed-upon price and date.&#x20;

There are two types of options: [**puts**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp)**,** _which is a bet that a stock **will fall**_**,** or [**calls**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp)**, **_**** which is a bet that a stock **will rise**_.&#x20;

* **Put** options allow the holder to **sell** the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe.
* **Call** options allow the holder to **buy** the asset at a stated price within a specific timeframe.

### Strike Price <a href="#mntl-sc-block_1-0-18" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-18"></a>

The strike price determines whether an option should be exercised. It is the price that a trader expects the stock to be above or below by the expiration date. If a trader is betting that International Business Machine Corp. ([IBM](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=ibm)) will rise in the future, they might buy a call for a specific month and a particular strike price. For example, a trader is betting that IBM's stock will rise above $150 by the middle of January. They may then buy a January $150 call.
