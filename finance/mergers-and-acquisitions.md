# Mergers and Acquisitions

* The terms "**mergers**" and "**acquisitions**" are often used interchangeably, but they differ in meaning.
* In an **acquisition**, one company purchases another outright.
* A **merger** is the combination of two firms, which subsequently form a new legal entity under the banner of one corporate name.
* A company can be objectively valued by studying comparable companies in an industry and using metrics.

When one company takes over another and establishes itself as the new owner, the purchase is called an **acquisition**.

A **merger** describes two firms, of approximately the same size, that join forces to move forward as a single new entity, rather than remain separately owned and operated. This action is known as a [merger of equals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merger\_of\_equals.asp).

A purchase deal will also be called a merger when both CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both of their companies.

#### Mergers <a href="#mntl-sc-block_1-0-22" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-22"></a>

In a merger, the [boards of directors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boardofdirectors.asp) for two companies approve the combination and seek shareholders' approval.&#x20;

#### Acquisitions <a href="#mntl-sc-block_1-0-28" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-28"></a>

In a simple acquisition, the acquiring company obtains the majority stake in the acquired firm, which does not change its name or alter its organizational structure.&#x20;

#### Consolidations <a href="#mntl-sc-block_1-0-31" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-31"></a>

[Consolidation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consolidation.asp) creates a new company by combining core businesses and abandoning the old corporate structures. Stockholders of both companies must approve the consolidation, and subsequent to the approval, receive common [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) shares in the new firm.

#### Tender Offers <a href="#mntl-sc-block_1-0-34" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-34"></a>

In a tender offer, one company offers to purchase the outstanding stock of the other firm at a specific price rather than the market price. The acquiring company communicates the offer directly to the other company's shareholders, bypassing the management and board of directors.&#x20;

#### Acquisition of Assets <a href="#mntl-sc-block_1-0-37" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-37"></a>

In an acquisition of assets, one company directly acquires the assets of another company. The company whose assets are being acquired must obtain approval from its shareholders. The purchase of assets is typical during [bankruptcy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankruptcy.asp) proceedings, wherein other companies bid for various assets of the bankrupt company, which is liquidated upon the final transfer of assets to the acquiring firms.

#### Management Acquisitions <a href="#mntl-sc-block_1-0-40" id="mntl-sc-block_1-0-40"></a>

In a management acquisition, also known as a [management-led buyout (MBO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbo.asp), a company's executives purchase a controlling stake in another company, taking it private. These former executives often partner with a financier or former corporate officers in an effort to help fund a transaction.&#x20;
