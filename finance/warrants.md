# Warrants

Warrants are a derivative that give the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security—most commonly an equity—at a certain price before expiration

A stock [warrant](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warrant.asp) gives the holder the right to buy a stock at a certain price at a predetermined date. Similar to call options, investors can exercise stock warrants at a fixed price. When issued, the price of a warrant is always higher than the underlying stock but carries a long-term exercise period before they expire. When an investor exercises a stock warrant, the company issues new common shares to cover the transaction, as opposed to call options where the call writer must provide the shares if the buyer exercises the option.

Stock warrants normally trade on an exchange but volume can be low, generating liquidity risk. Like call options, the price of a warrant includes a time premium that decays as it approaches the expiration date, generating additional risk. The value of the warrant expires worthless if the price of the underlying security doesn't reach the exercise price before the expiration date.

### Options vs Warrants

A stock warrant differs from an option in two key ways: **a company issues its own warrants**, and **the company issues new shares for the transaction**. Additionally, a company may issue a stock warrant if they want to raise additional capital from a stock offering. If a company sells shares at $100 but a warrant is just $10, more investors will exercise the right of a warrant. These warrants are a source of future capital.

Stock options are listed on exchanges. When stock options are exchanged, the company itself does not make any money from those transactions. **Stock warrants can last for up to 15 years, whereas stock options typically exist for a month to two to three years.**

Therefore, for long-term investments, stock warrants may be a better investment than stock options because of their longer terms. However, stock options may be a better short-term investment.
