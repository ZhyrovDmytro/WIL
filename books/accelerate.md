## 24 key capabilities that drive improvements in software delivery performance

Capabilities classified in five categories:

* Continuous delivery
* Architecture
* Product and process
* Lean management and monitoring
* Cultural

### Continuous delivery capabilities

1. Version control
2. Deployment automation
3. Continuous integration
4. Trunk-based development
5. Test automation
6. Test data management
7. 'Shift left' on security - building security is a part of a day to day work, not separate&#x20;
8. Continuous delivery

### Architecture Capabilities

&#x20;9\. Loosely coupled architecture

&#x20;10\. Empowered teams

### Product and process capabilities

&#x20;11\. Customer feedback

&#x20;12\. Value stream

&#x20;13\. Working in small batches

&#x20;14\. Team experimentation

### Lean management and monitoring capabilities

&#x20;15\. Change approval process

&#x20;16\. Monitoring

&#x20;17\. Practice notification

&#x20;18\. WIP limits

&#x20;19\. Visualizing work

### Cultural capabilities

&#x20;20\. Westrum organizational culture

&#x20;21\. Supporting learning

&#x20;22\. Collaborating among teams

&#x20;23\. Job satisfaction

&#x20;24\. Transformational leadership

## Continuous delivery

This is a set of capabilities that enable us to get changes of all kinds - features, fixes, conf. changes - into production _safely_, _quickly_, _sustainably_&#x20;

### Key principles of CD:

* build quality in
* work in a small batches
* computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve problems
* continues improvement, team is never satisfied
* everyone is responsible
* comprehensive config. management - build,test,deploy of software is fully automated
* continuous integration
* continuous testing - automated/unit tests run against each commit to receive fast feedback

## Making work sustainable

**To reduce deployment pain:**

* build systems that are designed to be deployed easily into multiple environments, can detect and tolerate failures on their env., and can have various components of the system updated independently
* ensure that the state of the production system can be reproduced (without prod data), in an automated fashion from info from git
* deployment should be as easy as possible
