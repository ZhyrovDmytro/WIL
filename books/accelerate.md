## 24 key capabilities that drive improvements in software delivery performance

Capabilities classified in five categories:

* Continuous delivery
* Architecture
* Product and process
* Lean management and monitoring
* Cultural

### Continuous delivery capabilities

1. Version control
2. Deployment automation
3. Continuous integration
4. Trunk-based development
5. Test data management
6. Shift left on security
7. Continuous delivery

## Continuous delivery

This is a set of capabilities that enable us to get changes of all kinds - features, fixes, conf. changes - into production _safely_, _quickly_, _sustainably_&#x20;

### Key principles of CD:

* build quality in
* work in a small batches
* computers perform repetitive tasks, people solve problems
* continues improvement, team is never satisfied
* everyone is responsible

## Making work sustainable

**To reduce deployment pain:**

* build systems that are designed to be deployed easily into multiple environments, can detect and tolerate failures i their env., and can have various components of the system updated independently
* ensure that the state of production system can be reproduced (without prod data), in an automated fashion from info from git
* deployment should be as easy as possible
