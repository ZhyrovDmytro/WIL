# EDGE

## Tech Core

**Steps to successful digital transformation:**

* Removing friction from engineering teams
* Building an ecosystem around assets
* Experimenting efficiently and effectively with assets

### Friction in eng teams

Friction - resistance to movement, or conflict between people. Friction slows us down. Also arise from using the wrong technology for an initiative (existing standards).&#x20;

Remove barriers to faster delivery and improve adaptability.

In waterfall projects, it is easier to cut refactoring, for example. Impact is felt in future, enginers fell a pin of tech debt and customers feel the pain of lengthy delivery schedules.

### Building an Asset Ecosystem

Big tech com with huge tech debt, strategy needs to be well considered "layered" strategy where the layers are time.

## Edge Principles

#### Outcome-based strategy -> value based prioritization -> lightweight planing and governance

#### Adaptive,learning culture -> self-sufficient, collab decisions -> Autonomous teams



### Outcome-based strategy

_Customer outcomes **first**, business benefits **second**._
