# The Feynman technique

1. Pick a topic you want to understand and start studying it
2. Pretend to teach the topic to a classroom or a child or someone who is unfamiliar with the topic
3. Go back to the resource material when you get stuck
4. Simplify and Organize

**Step 1**

During the learning step it is very important not just to memorize the topic but rather to **understand the principles**. Another good method of studying is to write.

**Step 2 **

> If you want to master something, teach it. Teaching is a powerful tool for learning.

Break things down is as much simpler and plain language as possible and pretend to explain it to a 5 years old child or to a person who is completely out of the topic. The easiest way to explain it on an example using the very basic and familiar things.

**Step 3**

When you are stuck with explanations using basic words or cannot make a connection with the main topic just get back to the source and fill the gap. 

**Step 4**

After revisiting the source and filling the gap in the knowledge you try again to explain the same concept with plain language and make your initial explanation even better. _**Use these steps over and over again till you master the concept.**_
