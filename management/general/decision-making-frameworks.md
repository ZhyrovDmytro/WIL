# Decision-making frameworks

### Authoritarian decision-making&#x20;

Advantages: fast, direct, few compromises.

Disadvantages: low buy-in, risky because of lack of knowledge&#x20;

Done by one individual, rare

### Consultive decision-making

Advantages: increase buy-in, more informative

Disadvantages: takes longer

Done by one individual but with consultancy from others

### Consensus decision-making

&#x20;Advantages: Everyone is involved, greater buy-in

Disadvantages: time to decision

Input is given and no one will sabotage it, no decision can be made until everyone agrees.

### Majority decision-making

Backup to consensus model.

Advantages: could be done quicker, decision not that watered down

Disadvantages: winners vs losers
