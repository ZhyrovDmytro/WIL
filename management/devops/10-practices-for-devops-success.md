# 10 Practices for DevOps success

### Incident Command system

Incident management includes an explicit emphasis on involving developer teams from the beginning- [including on-call](10-practices-for-devops-success.md#developers-on-call) --and assigning work based on expertise, not job titles

**1. Detection  - **set up monitoring tools, alert system, and runbook that help each member know who to contact when the accident is detected

**2. Response **- not one on-call ing but multiple team members to be available for escalations.

**3. Resolution - **DevOps incident management teams can often get to resolution quickly. This is because, as a whole, they're more familiar with the application or system code

**4. Analysis  ** - close out an incident with a blameless [postmortem process.](10-practices-for-devops-success.md#blameless-postmortems) Come together to share information, metrics, and lessons-learned with a goal to continuously improve the resilience of their systems, as well as resolve future incidents quickly and efficiently

**5. Readiness - **the team take what they learned in their postmortem process and updates their runbooks and make any necessary adjustments to monitoring tools and alert systems. And the DevOps focus on continuous improvement applies to the people and team, not just the technology.

### Blameless Postmortems&#x20;

A blameless postmortem (or **retrospective**) is a post-incident document that helps teams figure out why an incident happened, and brainstorm how to improve the process to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

[Google's approach](https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/)

The blameless posmortems meeting investigates problems and incidents without making accusations or blaming any particular person or team. A blameless mindset assumes that all parties were doing the best they could with the information that they had at the time.
