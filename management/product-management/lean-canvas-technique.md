# Lean canvas technique

The **Lean Canvas** is the perfect one-page format for brainstorming possible business models

**Empty lean canvas:**

### 1. Problem <a href="#19bf" id="19bf"></a>

Each customer segment (CS) you are thinking to work with will have a set of problems that they need solving. In this box try listing the one to three high priority problems that you CS has. **Without a problem to solve, you don’t have a product/service to offer.**

### 2. Customer Segments <a href="#274d" id="274d"></a>

The problem and Customer Segments can be viewed as intrinsically connected — without a CS in mind you can’t think of their problems, and visa-versa.

### 3. Unique Value Proposition <a href="#b4ea" id="b4ea"></a>

In the middle of the canvas is the UVP. A value proposition is a promise of value to be delivered. It’s the primary reason a prospect should buy from you. A way to get your head around this is to think why are you different and why should your CS buy/invest time in you — further reading: [Useful Value Proposition Examples (and How to Create a Good One](http://conversionxl.com/value-proposition-examples-how-to-create/))

### 4. Solution <a href="#b275" id="b275"></a>

Finding a solution to the problem is the golden egg! You’re not going to get this right off the first bat — it’s OK, as that’s what Lean is all about. What you need to do is [Get Out The Building](http://steveblank.com/2014/03/18/get-the-heck-out-of-the-building-in-founders-school-part-2/) — a phrase coined by the godfather of Lean Startup, Steve Blanks. And what Blank’s here is that the solution is not in your office, it’s out there in the streets. So go interview your customer segment, ask them questions, and take those learnings. Remember the Lean Startup is validated learning through a continual [Build — Measure — Learn](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) cycle.

### 5. Channels <a href="#de40" id="de40"></a>

Channels are ways for you to reach your CS. And remember that in the initial stages it’s important not to think about scale but to focus on learning. With that in mind try to think which channels will give you enough access to your CS at the same time give you enough learning. Channels can be email, social, CPC ads, blogs, articles, trade shows, radio & TV, webinars etc. and BTW you don’t have to be on all of them, just where your CS are.

### 6. Revenue Streams <a href="#873f" id="873f"></a>

How you price your business will depend on the type of model it is, however, it’s quite common for startups to lower their cost, even offer it for free to gain traction, however, this can pose a few problems. The key being it actually delays/avoids validation. Getting people to sign up for something for free is a lot different than asking them to pay. There is also the idea of perceived value.

### 7. Cost Structure <a href="#f929" id="f929"></a>

Here you should list all the operational costs for taking this business to market. How much will it cost to build / landing page? What is your burn rate — your total monthly running costs? How much will it cost to interview your customer segment? How much do market research papers cost? etc. You can then use these costs and potential revenue streams to calculate a rough break-even point.

### 8. Key Metrics <a href="#fe80" id="fe80"></a>

Every business, no matter what industry or size, will have some key metrics that are used to monitor performance. The best way to help with this is to visualize a funnel top down that flows from the large open top, through multiple stages to the narrow end. A good model to help with this is Dave McClure’s ARRRR (aka Pirate Metrics) — further reading: [Startup Metrics for Pirates](http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version)

### 9. Unfair Advantage <a href="#72f6" id="72f6"></a>

This is the most difficult to block to answer. However, do try to think about this as having an unfair advantage can help when it comes seeking partners & investors. Here is a [great definition of unfair advantage](http://blog.asmartbear.com/unfair-advantages.html): _“The only real competitive advantage is that which cannot be copied and cannot be bought.”_ — Jason Cohen. Unfair advantage can be insider information, a dream team, getting expert endorsements, existing customers etc. So rather than think about adding something like “commitment and passion” as an unfair advantage (because it is not), think about what you have that no one else can buy.
