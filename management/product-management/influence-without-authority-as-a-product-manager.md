# Influence without authority as a Product Manager

### 1. Always bring a data 

Without a data you are just another person with an opinion.

### 2. Show that you are listening 

Be an active listener. Create a safe environment where people can share opinions.

### 3. Think about your personal brand

Write a book, start a blog, give a talk, build your own project

### 4. Be a keeper of the vision

If you have a strong vision stick to it in any what you do.

### 5. Appeal to people self interests

### 6. Embrace resistance

There is always someone with the strongest voice than yours.

Don't push back opinions, embrace them because:

1. **They might be right.** You can't know everything. 
2. **You need to show them they are wrong.**

### 7. Explain your "why"

People want to know the reason behind decisions. Show the data, the research, explain the reasoning
