# Customer development

The Practice of establishing and continuous and iterative communication with a customer. It helps come up with ideas , hypotheses, try them out, get feedback and adapt the product accordingly \(Get feedback and use feedback\).

Customer development is a framework, according to it there are 4 steps in the **product lifecycle:**

* Discovery
* Validation
* Creation
* Building

### Validation

use customer interview to figure out if your product is needed and if it solves a real problem

### Development of the first version

use customer interview to understand what features you should build

### Iteration

Improve the product. Use customer interview to understand what is working and what is not, if customers enjoy the product, and what new features they might need.

### Build

Transform an organization from "startup" mentality to an ongoing, execution-focused company.

## Types of customer interviews

All Interviews are a mix of these types:

1. **Exploratory**
2. **Validation**
3. **Satisfaction oriented**
4. **Efficiency**

### Customer interview questions

**Question rules:**

1. **Ask open-ended questions!**
2. Don't ask binary question \(yes or no\)
3. Don't ask hypothetical question \(not real situation, people don't really know what they would do in hypothetical situations\)
4. Don't ask leading question \(do you want to save money? almost rethorical, these are questions that somehow include the answer\)
5. Don't ask Q that might make them lie \(don't put them in an awkward position\)

**"That's interesting. tell me more"**

### **Vulnerability of customer interview**

* It doesn't scale\(hard to use few interviews for big amount of users\)
* The data is qualitative \(also need quantitative data because it's more precise\)

#### Best practices how to run customer interviews:

* **Don't talk about your solution**, but talk about their problem. They might not know what they want, but they know what needs
* **Don't talk about your own opinions** - customers should talk more than you, you might get new ideas from their answers.
* **Create a comfortable environment**
* **Don't force the conversation, guide it**

#### Try to get an answer to these questions:

* **Who** is your customer?  
* **What** are their habits?
* **When** do they need your product?
* **Where** do they need it?
* **Why** do they need it?
