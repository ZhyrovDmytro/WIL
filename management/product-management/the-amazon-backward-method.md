# The Amazon backward method

Product development approach that starts with the team imagining the product is ready to ship. The product team’s first step is to draft a **press release** announcing the product’s availability. The audience for this press release is the product’s customer.

#### Objectives of the Working Backwards process:

1. Move to the design stage making expensive changes - unaccounted for needs of clients or stakeholders, mistakes in UX'e, unaccounted for risks
2. To focus the product and everyone who will make this product on solving the needs of the client.
3. Reduce the cost of communication when paravozing a future product to stakeholders.

Amazon writes **one pager** for every project involving more than two people.  
One pager — consists of a description of the project and questions and answers. There is no strict format.

**Six** pager is a formalized document that is written for large projects. \[the specific trashhold is not yet clear. Probably for what is set in the goal of +1 level and takes from six months\].

### How to write documents in Amazone

* purity of wording: all follow the rules, advantages described precisely, KISS!!!
* document as a product
* if you speak about the future - add the date

### Six pager

1. Who is the client?
2. What is the problem or opportunity for the client?
3. What is the main value we create for the client?
4. How do we know the client needs it?
5. What will the customer experience look like?

### Press release

1. Heading - name the product.
2. Sub-Heading - Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
3. Summary - Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else **so make this paragraph good**.
4. Problem - Describe the problem your product solves.
5. Solution - Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
6. Quote from You - A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
7. How to Get Started - Describe how easy it is to get started.
8. Customer Quote - Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
9. Closing and Call to Action - Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

The **Press release** could not be larger than half of A4 page, easy language.
