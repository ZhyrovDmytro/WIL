# Prioritisation

### The assumption method

Prioritise by the assumptions, try the riskiest assumptions first. Take a riskiest assumption and give to it a score from 1 to 10, 10 is max risk, rate an important of doing that from 1 to 10, 10 is very important, _add these values and prioritise assumptions based on that ._

`Risk + importance = Rank`

### The BUC method

* business benefits
* user benefits
* cost

Score these dimensions from 1 to 10.

`B + U - C = Rank`

Prioritise based on this rank, the highest on the top.

### The MOSCOW method

* **Must** - must features, without we can't go further
* **Should** - features that should be included if possible
* **Could** - desirable but no essential features
* **Would/Won't** - we agree that this feature will not be in current release

### Value/Effort Matrix

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)

Setup effort and value for each idea you have.

* Top-left **-> Bring lots of value hard to implement**. (Big bets)
* Top-right **-> Easy to implement and high value.** (_<mark style="background-color:blue;">This is a  quick win</mark>!!!_)
* Bottom-left **-> Small value hard to implement** (Less prio, doesn't worse)
* Bottom-right **-> Bottom Right is Maybes.** (Can be done later)

### **ICE technique**

**I -** features that bring impact to the customer

**C -** confidence in the future

**E -** implement a feature with **ease**

ICE Score = I \* C \* E
