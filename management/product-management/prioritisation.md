# Prioritisation

### The assumption method

Prioritise by the assumptions, try the riskiest assumptions first. Take a riskiest assumption and give to it a score from 1 to 10, 10 is max risk, rate an important of doing that from 1 to 10, 10 is very important, _add these values and prioritise assumptions based on  that ._ 

`Risk + importance = Rank`
