# 7 steps to run MVP experiment

### 1. Figured out the problem/solution

### 2. Identifying the assumptions and find riskiest

Ideas come from observations or intuitions. We know nothing, everything that we think is an assumption. 

**I assume that:** 

* my user has an  x,y,z  problem
* \_\_\_\_ matters to my customer
* \_\_\_\_ will pay for it
* No satisfactory substitutes

Differentiate assumptions by risk and difficulty.  Difficulty refers to how hard would be to figure out if this assumption is real and how hard would be to test it.

### 3. Build testable hypotheses around assumptions

A hypothesis is a single, written, testable statement of what you believe to be true, with regards to the assumptions that you've identified.

**Basic hypothesis** \(for a new product\)**:**

_We believe \[target group of people\] will \[predicted action\] because \[reason\]._

**Basic hypothesis** \(for an existing product\)**:**

_If we \[action\], we believe \[subject\] will \[predicted action/outcome\] because \[reason\]._

**General hypothesis !!!:**

_We believe \[subject\] has a \[problem\] because \[reason\]. If we \[action\], this \[metric\] metric will improve._

### 4. Establish minimum criteria for success

There are three different outcomes to an MVP test: 

1. You find out that your hypothesis is false 
2. You find out that your hypothesis is true 
3. You're somewhere in the middle

**90% of the MVP experiments you are going to run are going to end up somewhere in the middle.**

To identify \(**Minimum Criteria for success**\) compare costs and benefits, at the point where is **the benefits &gt; the costs** this is it.

**The cost must be lower than the reward, in order for the product to be worth building**

### 5. Pick the type of MVP and the strategy

### 6. Execute the MVP experiment

### 7. Evaluating and learning from the experiment
