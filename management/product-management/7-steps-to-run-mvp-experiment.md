# 7 steps to run MVP experiment

### 1. Figured out the problem/solution

### 2. Identifying the assumptions and find riskiest

Ideas come from observations or intuitions. We know nothing, everything that we think is an assumption. 

**I assume that:** 

* my user has an  x,y,z  problem
* \_\_\_\_ matters to my customer
* \_\_\_\_ will pay for it
* No satisfactory substitutes

Differentiate assumptions by risk and difficulty.  Difficulty refers to how hard would be to figure out if this assumption is real and how hard would be to test it.

### 3. Build testable hypotheses around assumptions

A hypothesis is a single, written, testable statement of what you believe to be true, with regards to the assumptions that you've identified

### 4. Establish minimum criteria for success

### 5. Pick the type of MVP and the strategy

### 6. Execute the MVP experiment

### 7. Evaluating and learning from the experiment
