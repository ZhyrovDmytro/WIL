# SaaS Metrics

**The 3 Keys to Success in SaaS:**

1. Acquiring Customers
2. Retaining Customers
3. Monetizing Customers

_**As soon as the business has shown that it can succeed, it should invest aggressively to increase the growth rate.**_

SaaS is usually a “winner-takes-all” game, and it is therefore important to grab market share as fast as possible to make sure you are the winner in your space.

To calculate if you can **earn more than spend** to acquire customers you need these metrics:

* **LTV** – the _Lifetime Value of a typical customer_
* **CAC** – the _Cost to Acquire a typical Customer_

Is the business profitable in long run, time to profitability:
