# How to pick a good metric

**Exploratory metrics** - not always tracked, but they are there and it is possible to analyze them.

**Reporting metrics** - tracked for a long period of time.

**The good metric should be:**

1. Understandable
2. Rate or Ratio  - help you understand if you're heading towards those goals or away from them.
3. Correlated
4. **Change the way you behave** - what will you do differently based on changes in the number? If you don't know, it's a bad metric.
5. **Important to the company growth and objectives**
6. **Possible to improve** - good metrics measure progress, which means there needs to be room for improvement
