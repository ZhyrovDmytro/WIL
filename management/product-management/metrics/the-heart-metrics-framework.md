# The HEART metrics framework

**H**appiness - how happy is your user?

**E**ngagement - How engaged is your user in the short term?

**A**doption - How many interested users have actually tried your product?

**R**etention - How many users do you retain long term?

**T**ask Success - How successful are you at allowing users to perform the most valuable task?

1. Adoption
2. Task Success
3. Engagement
4. Retention
5. Happiness

| **Goals** | Signals | Metrics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| What do you want to happen? | What is the thing we need to measure? | A signal is expressed over time. This is the thing you watch. |

**Tips to using the HEART framework:**

* It is flexible - use it for product area or the whole company
* Use it for reporting, it is not exploring a framework
* Not strict rules, don't use all metrics, pick the most important ones
* Signal column could be used as tracking AC for engineers
