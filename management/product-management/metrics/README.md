Metrics are also called KPI - Key Performance Indicators

[How to pick a good metrics](how-to-pick-a-good-metric.md)

[The HEART metrics Framework](the-heart-metrics-framework.md)

Examples of metrics:

* monthly active users
* returning users
* churn users
* app store reviews
* Facebook and Twitter posts

### Growth & Activation metrics

Track and measure how your product is growing

**examples**: _total new users_, _new users by source_, _activated users._ There's a big difference between someone who only installed your app and an activated user.

**An activated user** is someone who actually signed up and performed an action inside the app

### Retention metrics

Track how many people are coming back to use your app repeatedly.

**examples**: _retained users, resurrected users._

**Retained users** are users who are using your app all the time_._

**Resurrected users** __are users who haven't been using your app for a while, but they're coming back after you notified them about, let's say, some attractive new feature

### Engagement metrics

Track how many times users are engaging with the app.

These metrics are tailored to each company and product.

### User happiness metrics

Track how happy your users are.

**examples**: _net promoter scores, number of customers that have written complaints, app store rating._

These are some of the most difficult metrics to measure, but are very important.

### Revenue metrics

Track how much revenue you are making.

**examples:** 

* cost per acquisition \(how much money do

  you have to spend in marketing/ads/salaries

  to acquire a customer?\) - we want  to have as small as possible

* monthly recurring revenue
* annual recurring revenue
* lifetime value \(how much revenue, on average, on a certain period of time, does each customer generate?\)
