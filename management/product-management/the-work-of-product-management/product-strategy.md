# Product strategy

> **Product Strategy** is a system of achievable goals and visions that work together to align the team around desirable outcomes for both the business and your customers.

### **Vision** <a href="fe4a" id="fe4a"></a>

The vision is your high level, ultimate view of where the company or business line is going.

Think long term, keep it qualitative. This is a good chance to talk about competitors, how customers will see you, and ambitions for expansion.

### Challenge <a href="420f" id="420f"></a>

The challenge is **the** **first** **Business goal **you have to achieve on the way to your longer term vision. 

This can be qualitative or quantitative. Try to keep these still in broad, high level terms.

### Target Condition <a href="07c4" id="07c4"></a>

The target condition helps break down the Challenge. These are set in terms of achievable, measurable metrics.

### Current State

What the current reality is compared to the Target Condition. It should be measured and quantified before the work starts to achieve the first target condition.\


{% hint style="info" %}
When we are building products, we have a threshold of knowledge. We cannot start on Day 1 and exactly plan to reach our vision. There are too many unknowns and variables. Instead, **we set goals along the way**, then remove obstacles through experimentation until we reach our vision.
