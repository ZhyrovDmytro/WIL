# Product/feature requirements

### Creating a product requirements document

[https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/requirements](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/product-management/requirements)

### Bussines requirements

Focus on the product as a whole.

### Function requirements

A functional requirement is a behavior that the product should do or support.

### Non-functional (quality, performance, security) requirements

Non-Functional Requirements serve as a description of how well a product must perform.

### User requirements

User requirements outline exactly what tasks the users can do with the product.



### While describing requirements keep questions in mind:

* Is a solution just a possible option? &#x20;
* Is the solution the only one possible?
* &#x20;Is the solution addressing the wrong problem?
* &#x20;Is the solution just to attract developer interest?
* &#x20;Is the client more solution focused?
