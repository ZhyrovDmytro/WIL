# Pricing

Pricing includes:&#x20;

* Customer value
* Competitive environment&#x20;
* Cost of product

### Pricing approaches

#### Cost-plus pricing

Fixed markup  added to the cost of a product, very common method, very often used by retail

#### Competitive reference

The pricing of a main competitor is a primary anchor point. Discount below, the premium above, or match the pricing.

#### Value-based pricing

Price is based on value the customer sees in a product. Consider price demand elasticity and customers willing to pay. Opportunities for higher margin.
