# MVP techniques

### E-mail MVP

Email client, email list/base, email writing skill

* By pitching them on a new product, you can see how they

  react in a simulated scenario

* If you don't have an email list, you can gather emails from

  potential customers

* Take a more personal tone to avoid getting into Spam

### Shadow button MVP

Instead of building a new feature, you can show a button that supposedly links people to that specific feature

The link might work and get them to another page, saying the feature is coming soon, or ~~it might just look broken~~

**The number of clicks you get will signal the amount of interest**

**404 and coming soon page**

You act like you're adding a new feature, and when the user navigates to the page, it either displays a 404 error message or a page that says the product is coming soon and that will ask you to sign up

#### _Amazon.com is using this type of MVP very frequently_

### **Explainer** MVP **video**

You show the video that explains a new feature. Exist two types of video:

* **tutorial video** - explain how he uses that specific feature, even if it's not real yet, by adding video effects that make it look real
* **sale video** - make a fake promo that pitches the product by explaining its benefits

**Dropbox did it**

### Fake landing page

Create one singular page that pitches the benefits of the product, and that has a call to action somewhere on the page, and then you drive traffic to the page

### Concierge service MVP

Concierge service is a service where you get one on one support from someone who manually goes through a task

Instead of making a feature/product, you can launch an informal offering to a small subset of users as a beta version

### Piecemeal MVP

Take what's available in terms of out of the box software, you piece them together, and you can get the functionality you need to test your basic version

### Wizard of Oz MVP

This MVP looks completely made, but all the tasks that computers and automated systems should be doing are being done manually

**Zappos is a classic example of a company that used this type of MVP**
