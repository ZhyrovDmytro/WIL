##The Amazon backward method
 
Product development approach that starts with
the team imagining 
the product is ready to ship. 
The product team’s first step is to draft 
a press release announcing the product’s availability. 
The audience for this press release 
is the product’s customer.

###Objectives of the Working Backwards process:

 1. Move to the design stage making 
  expensive changes - unaccounted for needs of 
  clients or stakeholders, mistakes in UX'e, 
  unaccounted for risks

 2. To focus the product and everyone who will
  make this product on solving
  the needs of the client.

 3. Reduce the cost of communication
   when paravozing a future product to stakeholders.

 Amazon writes <b>one pager</b> for every project
 involving more than two people.  
 One pager — consists of a description of the project
 and questions and answers. There is no strict format.

<b> Six</b> pager is a formalized document
 that is written for large projects.
[the specific trashhold is not yet clear.  
Probably for what is set in the goal of +1 level
and takes from six months].
