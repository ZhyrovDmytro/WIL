# Product Vision

**Vision** - a vivid mental image, especially a fanciful one of the future.

**Visionary** - _especially when referring to a person_ - a visionary is one who is thinking about or planning the future with imagination or wisdom.

### Examples of product visions

#### <mark style="background-color:orange;">Facebook</mark>

**Global vision:**&#x20;

* In the future, every single person on the planet will be connected to the internet
* Artificial intelligence will be good enough that we can talk to computers like humans
* VR / AR will be a vital part of daily life for most people

**Company vision:**&#x20;

By 2026, every single person on the planet will be connected inside some part of the Facebook ecosystem - over a billion new users - with the majority of these new users enabled via the internet.org operation (drone internet)

**Goals:**

* Continue expanding and improving the portfolio of Facebook products over the next 3 years to:

1. increase the number of connections between users and
2. increase the amount of time spent within the Facebook ecosystem, thus increasing the amount of data collected from them in various contexts

* Connect the rest of the world by 2026 - people in areas of the world where they currently do not have internet access.
* Be a foremost provider of VR / AR hardware as well as experiences and content for it

**Initiatives:**

* Build the technology necessary (their drone and other initiatives in internet.org) to give people in developing nations network access where it did not exist before
* Establish relationships with the governments of all nations, but especially developing nations, to enable citizens to use the technology above
* As time goes on, invest increasing amounts in connectivity, AR / VR, and AI

**Global vision:**

In the future, due to a combination of necessity and curiosity, humans must be / will be a multi-planetary species to ensure our survival

* One big reason this global vision is able to be backed up is that Elon Musk publicly stated that he and SpaceX believe that "A future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not"
* Mars will be the first extra-terrestrial location to establish human life on, given our current understanding. By eventually terraforming it, humans could establish a civilization there indefinitely
* Government-led programs to accomplish this are much less effective and will not produce the desired results in time

**Company vision:**

* By the year 2030, SpaceX will have developed and be the primary provider of technologies to make interplanetary travel and inhabitation for all humans possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars
* We will revolutionize re-usable vehicles as opposed to developing propulsion technology, as we know that this the biggest key to rapid cost reduction in space travel

**Goals:**

* By the year 2030, improve the cost and reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten (making it cost $500 per pound / $1,100/kg or less). This means the average cost of a Mars trip would be about $200,000 and decrease rapidly from there
* SpaceX should be the largest and most reliable contractor for governments to deliver goods to space
* By the end of 2018, further increase profitability by securing contracts with governments to fly humans to the ISS cheaper than they can
* By mid-2019, launch our first unmanned mission to Mars - a robotic test flight with a modified Dragon capsule
* Each year, the SpaceX business should be profitable enough to fund and develop the technology necessary to send humans to Mars on the side

**Initiatives:**

* Fund the goals and vision by continuing to make a profit delivering satellites and cargo to space for governments and other entities
* Build and make reliable a re-usable first stage rocket to reduce costs and increase profitability
* Build an autonomous sea-going landing vehicle to intercept the reusable rocket (drone ship)
* Build spacecraft with progressively heavier payloads to land higher value contracts and gain knowledge for payload capacities that will be necessary for Mars missions
* Prepare our rockets for human cargo in mid-2019 (and thus more government contracts) by building human safety features. Firstly, we will build a launch abort system to allow humans to safely escape a Falcon 9 rocket in the event of a launch failure
