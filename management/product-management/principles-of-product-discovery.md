# Principles of product discovery

### 1. We can't count on our customers/stakeholders/executives

They don't know what is possible, with tech products none of us know what we really want until we see it

### 2. Establish compelling value

we need to create value that customer choose to buy or use.

**We CAN(!) survive for a while with usability issues or performance issues, but without core value we have nothing**

### 3. UX is important

### 4. Functionality, tech, design are very close together and intertwined

### 5. We expect that many of our ideas won't work and the ones that do will require several iterations.

### 6. Validate ideas on real customers

Do it **before** we spend the time and expense to build an actual product, not after.

### 7. Validate ideas in the fastest, cheapest way possible.

### 8. Validate the feasibility of our ideas during discovery, not after

### 9. Validate business viability of our ideas during discovery, not after

### 10. It is about shared learning

Team see customer pain together, they watch how some ideas failed and other work, they all understand the context why it is important and what needs to be done.
