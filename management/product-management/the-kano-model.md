# The Kano Model

**The Kano Model** is an approach to prioritizing features on a roadmap, the key consideration for any new feature is how much it will satisfy users.

### Kano Model’s 5 Categories

#### Performance (more => better)

_These are the requirements the customers are able to articulate and are at the top of their minds when evaluating options._ They are the most visible of the model’s requirements and the better they are performed, the more satisfaction they bring, conversely, the worse they are performed, the more dissatisfaction they bring. **The better you execute these the more satisfaction from the customer you get.**

#### Basic (Must-be)

_These are the requirements that the customers expect and are taken for granted._ When done well, customers are just neutral, but **when done poorly, customers are very dissatisfied**. **They are the requirements that must be included and are the price of entry into a market.**

#### Excitement (Attractive)

_These are the requirements that are unexpected and pleasant surprises or delights._ These are the innovations you bring into your offering. They delight the customer when there, but do not cause any dissatisfaction when missing because the customer never expected them in the first place.

#### Indifferent

_These are the requirements that the customers simply don’t care_ if they are present or absent, their satisfaction remains neutral under either circumstance.

#### Reverse

_Simply stated, these are the requirements that **cause dissatisfaction when present and satisfaction when absent**._ These are very rare but do happen occasionally.

As customer expectations change with the level of performance from competing products. Attributes can move from delighter to performance need and then to basic need.

For example, In 2009, mobile phone charge would last 12 hours. As each new mobile phone generation imoproved battery life, the attribute of 12-hour battery life has shifted from delighter to less than a basic need

To apply Kano Model follow steps:

1. Research and brainstorm all of the possible features and attributes of your product or service, and everything you can do to please your customers.
2. Classify these as Basic, Performance or Excitement Attributes and add a fourth type, Not Relevant. These are the things that don't add value because customers don't care about them.
3. Make sure that your product or service has all of the essential Basic Attributes. If necessary, eliminate some Performance Attributes so that you can include these features.
4. Assess the Excitement Attributes, and think about how you can incorporate some of them into your product or service. Again, if necessary, cut some Performance Attributes, so that you can afford to invest in your Excitement Attribute.
5. Choose the Performance Attributes that you can deliver at a competitive price, while still maintaining an acceptable profit margin.
