# Extreme programming

**Extreme programming** - dev. methodology which is aim to produce higher quality software with fast response to frequently changing customer requirements.

### 13 Practice of XP

1. **Whole team**. - All contributors in the project with XP work as one team. The team includes a business representative - ''customer", programmers, may includes testers, scrum master\(coach\), may includes manager who coordinate activities. **Everyone in a team contributes in a way that they can. The best teams have no specialists, only general contributors with special skills.**
2. **Planning Game -** there are two step processes - release planning and iteration planning. **Release process**: developers meet 'customer' and define functionality needed to release date. Split this on small chanks, deliver small pieces of functionality as fast as possible\(max 1 day\). **The Backlog** is created with tasks, prioritized by ''customer'. If the team is not able to deliver all functionality to release date, release date is not postponed but the functionality the least important is cut.
3. **Small releases -** new versions released often with small functionality, better testing, faster response, each iteration with small business value.
4. **Test-Driven Development\(TDD\)** -  write the test first then make it work. Tests should run all the time, coverage near to 100%.
5. **Collective Code Ownership** - each developer can change any piece of code.
6. **Continuous Integration \(CI\) -** keep the system fully integrated at all times. Build multiple times per day \(**One XP team of forty people builds at least eight or ten times per day!**\). Response to new code is fast, team works with the latest code.
