# Objective and key results \(OKR\)

Is a **goal setting framework** used by individuals, teams, and organizations to define measurable goals and track their outcomes.

OKRs comprise an **objective** \(a significant, concrete, clearly defined goal\) and 3-5 **key results** \(measurable success criteria used to track the achievement of that goal, benchmark and monitor how we get to the objective\).

Key results should be measurable, **either on a 0â€“100% scale or with any numerical value** \(e.g., dollar amount, percentage\).

Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive but realistic. They are measurable and verifiable.

You meet the result or you don't there is no something in between.

At the end of the defined period, there is a regular check the key result is fulfilled or not.
