# Extreme programming

[Original idea of XP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/start.html)

**Extreme programming** - dev. methodology which is aim to produce higher quality software with fast response to frequently changing customer requirements.

## 13 Practice of XP

1. **Whole team**. - All contributors in the project with XP work as one team. The team includes a business representative - ''customer", programmers, may includes testers, scrum master\(coach\), may includes manager who coordinate activities. **Everyone in a team contributes in a way that they can. The best teams have no specialists, only general contributors with special skills.**
2. **Planning Game -** there are two step processes - release planning and iteration planning. **Release process**: developers meet 'customer' and define functionality needed to release date. Split this on small chanks, deliver small pieces of functionality as fast as possible\(max 1 day\). **The Backlog** is created with tasks, prioritized by ''customer'. If the team is not able to deliver all functionality to release date, release date is not postponed but the functionality the least important is cut.
3. **Small releases -** new versions released often with small functionality, better testing, faster response, each iteration with small business value.
4. **Test-Driven Development\(TDD\)** -  write the test first then make it work. Tests should run all the time, coverage near to 100%.
5. **Collective Code Ownership** - each developer can change any piece of code.
6. **Continuous Integration \(CI\) -** keep the system fully integrated at all times. Build multiple times per day \(**One XP team of forty people builds at least eight or ten times per day!**\). Response to new code is fast, team works with the latest code.
7. **Coding standards -** the team follow coding standard.
8. **Metaphor -** common vision of how the system works. It compares with familiar thing so the team can easily understand how it works.
9. **Sustainable pace -** the team works hard but the pace is still sustainable. 
10. **Customer tests -** "customer" defines one or more automated acceptance tests to show that the feature is working. The team builds these tests and uses them to prove to themselves, and to the customer, that the feature is implemented correctly.
11. **Pair programming -** all prod software built by 2 programmers. It ensures that all production code is reviewed by at least one other programmer, the result is better designed, better tested, and better code.
12. **Simple design -** design is simple it is suited only for the current functionality of the system.
13. **Refactoring -** team continuously makes refactoring to adjust the system to current and new functionality. During refactoring team keeps design of the system simple and testable. 

### Advantages of XP

* Team can fast change/adjust the code with a new request from the 'customer'
* The code is stable because of CI, testing, simple design.
* It is easy to maintain the code because of refactoring and standard
* High code quality 
* Development Risks are lower because responsibility spreads widely.
* Costs lower, the  team is focused on code

### Disadvantages

* 'Customer' should be highly involved in the dev process 
* Hard to estimate the final release date, requirements are not known
* Depends on developers qualifications, senior devs are needed
* Stakeholders don't want to pay for pairprogramming
* Big culture changes
* doesn't fit for big projects

### Principles

1. **Simplicity -** the first solution is simple, we need only what we need right now, design is simple it covers only what is needed right now.
2. **Communication -** less documentation more live communication
3. **Feedback -**written software is shown early and changes made if needed, team talk about the project and adapt processes if needed. 
4. **Respect -** developers respect the expertise of the "customers" and vice versa. Respect to the product and delivering high-quality work/code.
5. **Courage -** team tells the truth about progress and estimation. Team adapts to changes, no one is working alone there is no space to fear.
