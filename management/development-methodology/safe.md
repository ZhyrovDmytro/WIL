# SAFe

The Scaled Agile Framework® \(SAFe®\) is a system for implementing Agile, Lean, and DevOps practices at scale.

### Benefits of SAFe

1. Faster time to market
2. Increase in quality
3. Increase in productivity
4. Better employee engagement

### SAFE principles

1. **Take an economic view** - Economics should inform and drive decisions at all levels, from Portfolio to Agile Teams

   Use lean Agile methods to archive best economics outcome:

   * Delivery early and often
   * Apply an economic framework

2. **Apply system thinking** -To improve, everyone must understand the larger aim of the system.  In SAFe, systems thinking is applied to the system under development, as well as to the organization that builds the system.
3. **Assume variability, preserve options** - In a true agile fashion, keeping the enterprise design lightweight and evolving over various stages of product development will result in quicker adaptability or course correction with respect to a volatile market situation.
4. **Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles -** Developing solutions incrementally in a series of short iterations allows for [faster customer feedback](feedback-loops.md). This enables faster integrated learning cycles and the teams need to be coached on leveraging various tools that help with this
5. **Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems -** The mindset to measure success correctly and quantitatively is achieved by adoption of early and continuous integration processes that can be applied iteration after iteration in a near production-like environment.
6. **Visualise and limit WIP, reduce batch sizes, and manage queue lengths**
7.  **Apply cadence, synchronise with cross-domain planning -** means and methods of cadenced synchronization that is needed to ensure multiple challenges are resolved amicably.
8.  **Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers**
9.  **Decentralise decision-making -** vast majority of the decisions need to be decentralised and left to the teams. This ensures one doesn’t fall into the pit of a command-and-control hierarchy
10.  **Organise around value -** lean principles focus on delivering the maximum customer value in the shortest sustainable lead time, whilst providing the highest possible quality to the customer. Getting the right product out into the right market at the right time, is absolutely critical.



Scaled Agile, Inc. provides a [SAFe implementation roadmap](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/implementation-roadmap/) that contains detailed steps on how to get started and set up the organization for widespread adoption across portfolios. The 12 steps for implementing SAFe include:

1. Reaching the tipping point
2. Train lean-agile change agents
3. Train executives, managers, and leaders
4. Create a lean-agile center of excellence
5. Identify value streams and ARTs \(Agile Release Trains\)
6. Create the implementation plan
7. Prepare for ART launch
8. Train teams and launch the ART
9. Coach the ART execution
10. Launch more ARTs and value streams
11. Extend to the portfolio
12. Sustain and improve
