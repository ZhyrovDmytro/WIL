# Web 3.0

Web 3.0 is the third generation of internet services for websites and applications that will focus on using a machine-based understanding of data to provide a data-driven and Semantic Web. The ultimate goal of Web 3.0 is to create more intelligent, connected and open websites.

Web 3.0 is built largely on three new layers of technological innovation: **edge computing**, **decentralised data networks** and **artificial intelligence**.

Main features of Web 3.0:

1. **Semantic Web -** improves web technologies in order to **generate, share and connect content through search and analysis based on the ability to understand the meaning of words**, rather than on keywords or numbers.
2. **Artificial Intelligence -** Combining this capability with natural language processing, in Web 3.0, [**computers can understand information like humans**](https://expert.ai/semantic-technology/?) **in order to provide faster and more relevant results**.
3. **3D Graphics - The three dimensional design is being used extensively in websites and services** in Web 3.0. Museum guides, computer games, ecommerce, geospatial contexts, etc. are all examples that use 3D graphics.
4. **Connectivity - information is more connected thanks to semantic metadata**. As a result, the user experience evolves to another level of connectivity that leverages all the available information.
5.  **Ubiquity - content is accessible by multiple applications**, every device is connected to the web, the services can be used everywhere.
