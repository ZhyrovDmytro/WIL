# How to Analyse Direct competition

### Why it is important

You will find answers to very important questions:

1. Finding out where your [products](https://www.marketing91.com/types-of-products/) stand in your market and your [market share](https://www.marketing91.com/market-share-definition/).
2. Finding out your immediate competitors and the competitors you should be careful of.
3. Targeting of the main competitors you want to beat to climb the competitive ladder
4. Understanding your own weaknesses as per your competitive ranking. And what you can do to improve.

### Step 1. Find your direct competitors

To find out direct competitors use[ **competitor analysis**](competitor-analysis.md)**.**

### Step 2 – Compare your Market with direct competitors

Here are some of the things you may notice**:**

1. There would be some areas where you are exclusively present
2. Some areas will have only the competitor present – **Attack this area**
3. A bulk of the area will have both of you present – **Compete in this area**
4. There would be an area where neither of you are present – **Think out of the box for this area**

****

**Defend the areas** where you are exclusively present. For this, you need to ensure that your [dealers](https://www.marketing91.com/how-to-manage-and-motivate-channel-dealers/) and distributors are within your hands and do not slip to the competitors.

**Attack the areas** where competitor is present or both of you are present – This is the area where you can get maximum market share from and you need to attack this area through [promotions](https://www.marketing91.com/promotions-in-marketing/), [Advertising](https://www.marketing91.com/what-is-advertising/), or any other means possible.

[**Differentiate**](https://www.marketing91.com/differentiation-strategy/) **or think out of the box** for areas which are not covered by you both. If they are not covered by you both then there is something missing in terms of coverage or [product](https://www.marketing91.com/what-is-a-product/) is not being used by those [people](https://www.marketing91.com/people-marketing-mix/). Then you need to **think out of the box** to offer a product to this market which is untapped.
